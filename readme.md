## Vanilla nodejs REST api with CRUD functionality

Practice http request response cycle, using a controller and model to get our products  
and really understand whats going on under the hood

# MVC - without the v

Models deal with data, whether it be data in a database or files.  
These functions will strictly be used for CRUD of the data.

Controllers are going to control what each route is doing, the status and data it sends,  
any headers we want to set and stuff like that. It will interact with the model and be the middle man.

# Final thoughts

Was nice to get another practice run at CRUD and making a vanilla node rest api. It makes me appreciate much more  
all the bells and whistles that comes with things like express. So many things is made much easier, like getting  
dynamic ids from the url, not having to use regex expressions to match urls - not nice at all!
